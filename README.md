# Spotify-Homepage-Clone

Project Overview: Creating a website clone is an ambitious endeavor, and I chose Spotify - one of the largest online marketplaces in terms of music globally -as my inspiration .The goal was to replicate Spotify  user interface and key features.Here's what I accomplished--
Static Website : I developed a static website using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.

Design Elements: The project mimics Spotify layout,including a navigation bar, search box, Song's cards, and footer.

Visual Appeal: I used external libraries like Font Awesome for icons and Google Fonts to enhance the overall  design.

 Responsive: The site adapts seamlessly to different laptop/PC screen sizes.
